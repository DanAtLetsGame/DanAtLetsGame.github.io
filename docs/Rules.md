## Reporting

If you have encountered a member who has broken any of the above rules, or not abided by specific game rules defined for a game server we host, please either email report@letsgame.org or send a private message to any moderator or admin in our Discord.

## Warnings

Moderators may hand out warnings based on behavior. This is up to the discretion of the moderator. Warnings will be tracked per user. If a user has received multiple warnings, the moderator may ban the user if they believe that is the best course of action.

## Bans

Moderators may ban users based on behavior. This is up to the discretion of the moderator. When a ban is given, the specified user will be banned from Discord and all game servers.

## Appeals

If you believe you've been given a warning or a ban and do not deserve it, please email appeals@letsgame.org and plead your case. A moderator will review your email and decide if revoking any warnings or bans is warranted. You will be notified via email reply as to their decision.
