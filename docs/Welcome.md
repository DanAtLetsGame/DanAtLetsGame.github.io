# Welcome

Our goal for LetsGame.org is to bring gamers together. We all love gaming, and many of us game with our friends daily, but sometimes we just don't have others to play with. This can be especially true for games that are locally hosted and/or the public servers just don't work for us (due to configuration, hours, location, etc). That's where we come in. Our hope with this community is to allow gamers to connect, setup and configure their own servers to their own preferences, and find others to join with them on their journey. While we do look to cater towards private/local servers for various games (such as Valheim, VRising, Rust, etc), if you do any type of gaming, you are welcome here.

# Communication
Our primary form of communication is via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XcZBaEmA38) server. It's here that we meet and chat with others, discuss new games, and have a good time. Anyone is welcome to join.

LetsGame.org mods are also available via email at mods@LetsGame.org, though Discord is your best bet for a quick response.
