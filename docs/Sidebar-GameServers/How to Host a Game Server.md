Our servers are hosted by our community members. If you'd like to host a game server for other LetsGame.org members to join, please continue reading.

## Responsibilities
When hosting a game server for LetsGame.org, you commit to the following responsibilities:

- Solid uptime
  - While we don't currently have a metric to define 'solid', we ask that you do your best to keep the server as available as it can be
- Downtime warnings
  - If you need to bring the server down for any reason, we ask that you provide a heads up to our members via the text channel for the game you are hosting
  - If the server goes down unexpectedly, please let our members know via the text channel for the game you are hosting
- Backups
  - A daily backup should be taken if possible
    - Backups should be provided to Mods/Admins of LetsGame.org in case of server crashes, corrupt data, or retirement from hosting
      - This allows a new community member to host the server from its last saved game state
    - A script can be provided to perform the backup, if needed
- Retiring
  - If you no longer wish to host a game server for LetsGame.org, or can no longer do so, we ask to provide as much heads up as you can via the text channel for the game you are hosting

## Benefits
When hosting a game server for LetsGame.org, some benefits will be provided:

- Exposure
  - Your server and name will be provided on our website, which should bring more players to your server
- Discord
  - You will receive the GameHost role, which will allow you to create events, forum threads, polls, and give you the ability to stream to members
  - If you prefer to stream via Twitch, Youtube, or another site, you will be allowed to link your stream in the text chat as long as you are streaming gameplay from one of our servers
    - It doesn't need to be the game/server you host...it can be any game/server hosted by our community

## Start Hosting
If you agree to the above responsibilities and would like to host a game for LetsGame.org, please email MemberHosting@letsgame.org, or private message a moderator in our Discord providing the following information:

- Your Discord Name
- Country/City where the server resides
- Game to Host
- Server rules/settings for the game (ie, pve/pvp, base raids, difficulty, etc) that are not the default
- A description of your server (ie, 'We are looking to focus on building massive cities. Less focus on combat.')
- Password for the server
- Any game specific rules (if you aren't sure, the answer is likely 'none')

> **Please note that some game host requests may not be approved, based on the game and the desire for our members to play said game, server location, or other criteria.**
